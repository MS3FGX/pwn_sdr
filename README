PWN_SDR is a script that will install the lastest build of RTL-SDR on your
Pwnie Express Pwn Plug. This includes installing the required dependencies,
pulling the latest RTL-SDR from git, and running a hardware diagnostic.

PWN_SDR can also start rtl_tcp, the server component of RTL-SDR, which allows
you to remotely control the SDR device connected to the Pwn Plug.

To use PWN_SDR, you need to have a Pwnie Express Pwn Plug, and a DVB-T tuner
based on the Realtek RTL2832U chip. Ideally your device will also have the
Elonics E4000 chip for the best frequency range, but that is not required for
operation.

As of the current version, PWN_SDR supports the following arguments:

install
    Installs required dependencies, downloads RTL-SDR, and compiles it.

uninstall
    Completely removes RTL-SDR and its dependencies.

upgrade
    Upgrade the RTL-SDR installation, does not remove dependencies, but does
remove currently installed build of RTL-SDR.

start
    Starts rtl_tcp to listen on the Pwn Plug's primary interface and with a set
sample rate.

stop
    Kills a currently running rtl_tcp daemon.

help
    Prints usage information.

- Sample Rate                                                                  -

I've found that, when connected to the Pwn Plug, RTL-SDR devices can't deliver
the same samples rates they do on the PC without dropping data. In my testing, 
the best I could get without losing data was 1.7 MHz.

This may be due to inherent hardware limitations of the Pwn Plug, but it would
be worth trying on your own hardware to confirm. The "rtl_test" program
included with RTL-SDR has a function to do exactly that. For example, a command
to attempt to sample data from your device at 1.9 MHz looks like this:

bash$ rtl_test -s rtl_test -s 2.0e6
Found 1 device(s):
  0:  ezcap USB 2.0 DVB-T/DAB/FM dongle

The "lost at least xx bytes" line shows that we are getting errors, and this
sample rate is too high. Try with increasingly lower frequencies until you no
longer see that message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the Pwn Plug has limited hardware capabilities, capturing data directly
on the local device is not recommended. Attempting to log data to the Pwn
Plug's internal storage is likely to lock the device up.

To overcome this, the best option is to use the server component of RTL-SDR,
called rtl_tcp. PWN_SDR is able to start and stop the daemon by executing it
with the appropriate options.

Once the rtl_tcp server has been started, you can connect to it from the remote
machine by entering your Pwn Plug's IP and port information into GNU Radio in
the following format:

rtl_tcp=192.168.1.40:1234
